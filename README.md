# Challenges (possible)
- Multiple or no pages flipped
- Adhesive needs to be replaced

# Lessons Learned
Before I built this robot I was not too familiar with coding or how motors worked, but now I understand the many intricicies of how stepper motors funciton and how to effectively control hardware interacting with the Hextech Board. Due to Hextech, I continue to grow my knowledge and experience in engineering quickly being able to interact mechanical components I build to python code I write.
